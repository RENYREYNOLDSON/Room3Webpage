## Interest of content

Very Good - there is a lot of content there, I won't pretend to have read it all, but from the headings it seems to be interesting. I would recommend paring it down slightly though, because the walls of text may drive away casual visitors.

## Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation

Good - the articles are very well presented, and images are used well. The home page is slightly offputting, given how large the text is, and the site's theme itself is fairly plain, but it gets the job done.

## Quality of Written Presentation

Good - the author of [this article](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=0d657003-bccc-44c1-8bb9-351ab28b3d04) was very good at writing interestingly and succinctly.

## Validity of HTML

Good - I can find no problems with the validity of the HTML as it is, however I have deducted points because the site was not hosted on gitpages, which prevented me from using lighthouse to validate it. Also, when testing on mobile, the site was highly unresponsive as the text on the index page was too big for the screen.

## Evidence of Collaboration

Excellent - it looks like everybody in the group contributed fairly evenly. There were multiple very recent commits, but these seem to mostly be small tweaks rather than doing everything at the last minute. Points docked for not including author information.
